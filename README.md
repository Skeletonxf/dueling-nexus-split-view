# Dueling Nexus Split View

This is the repository for a collection of css stylesheets to tweak duelingnexus.com.
It started out as a tweak for the chat overflowing onto the left side of the screen, and now is becoming multiple styles available at userstyles.org or to copy from for use in other css injection browser add ons.

This minimalist style tries to save as much vertical screen space as possible, makes the chat, card image and card container box fixed heights and scrollable, with the card info box then able to take up the majority of the vertical space.

All styles in this project are licensed under the MIT license.

This project used to contain more styles, but they are no longer in sync with Dueling Nexus and have been removed.
